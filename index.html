      <p>
      Music Therapist Toolkit is a comprehensive app for the music therapist. This page presents a design mock-up of the app.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h3>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_therapy">Music therapy</a> can improve the lives of millions of people. However, sometimes there are challenges for people who practice music therapy. These challenges include finding good songs, data collection, and in-the-field performance.</p>

      The Music Therapist Toolkit not only helps individual music therapists, but also helps the field of music therapy as a whole by enabling music therapists to better provide evidence supporting the clinical use of music therapy.
      </p>

      <h3><a name="features" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>
      <p>
      It features clinical tools that help music therapists work with client data, including a data tracker and assessment templates.
      </p>

      <p>
      It contains a song search interface that helps music therapists find effective music for a wide range of clients. It allows the music therapist to filter music by relevant populations, age, genre, and therapy goals. This song search interface can return chord charts/lead sheets and recordings.
      </p>

      <p>
      The Music Therapist Toolkit also helps music therapists organize client information, more accurately evaluate client goals and objectives, and track changes and progress over time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Furthermore, it provides the music therapist with quick access to everyday musical tools such as metronomes and tuners.
      </p>


      <p>
      This app is just one example of how technology can provide opportunities for the growth of music therapy.
